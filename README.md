# Dodger

## A game based on dodging obstacles 

Intended features:
- A **player controlled** object that can move in a single dimension.
- Various **obstacles** that are generated and move across the screen. 
- **Increasing** difficulty as the game progresses. 

This game can be played by anyone who wants to. This project is of interest to me as I enjoy playing various games and
creating a game would be interesting insight into the process in creating such games.
